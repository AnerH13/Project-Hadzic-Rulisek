# What If? Rewriting the Bundesliga with New Rules

  Al Jazeera, May 19, 2024 –

"Bayer Leverkusen sealed a historic unbeaten Bundesliga season as they lifted the title with a 2-1 win against Augsburg on Saturday."

This season will be etched in memory for decades, a feat of resilience and brilliance. But it wasn’t just about the wins—it was how Bayer Leverkusen won. A staggering 15 goals after the 90th minute across all competitions. Stretch it back to the 80th minute, and that number climbs to 33. These late-game goals became their lifeline, turning draws into victories and losses into dramatic comebacks.

With star players Victor Boniface (14), Florian Wirtz (11), and Alex Grimaldo (10) all hitting double-digit goal tallies, Leverkusen's firepower was undeniable. But here’s the real question:

What if those crucial late goals didn’t count?

Football, as we know, is a game of moments. And for Leverkusen, those final moments of each match became their defining strength. But how much did they rely on them? Would they still be champions if those last-minute surges of energy were erased from the record? And beyond that, how would the league table shift if key goals from each team’s top scorers were wiped from history?

Imagine a Bundesliga season where the final whistles blew earlier, where late-game saviors were silenced, and the clock didn’t offer one more chance. In this parallel universe, how many points would vanish? Who would rise, and who would fall?

We have the answers. And the revelations might just change how we view this “perfect” season. Dive into the alternate reality where late-game goals disappear, and find out which teams truly held their ground and which ones leaned too heavily on those fleeting moments of brilliance.
